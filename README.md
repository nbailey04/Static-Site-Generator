## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install and run the static site generator:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-static-site-generator.git
cd student-static-site-generator
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
You’ll need `markdown` and `jinja2`:

```bash
pip install markdown jinja2
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Add your content
Place your `.md` files (e.g., `about.md`, `contact.md`, etc.) into the `content/` folder. Here's an example Markdown file:

```markdown
# Hello World

This is my first static site!
```

### 2. Customize the template
Edit the `templates/base.html` file to change your layout. Here's an example base template:

```html
<html>
<head><title>{{ title }}</title></head>
<body>
    {{ content }}
</body>
</html>
```

You can enhance this with CSS, navigation bars, etc.

### 3. Generate your site
Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

All your rendered `.html` pages will appear inside the `dist/` folder.

### 4. View your site
Open the `.html` files in `dist/` with a web browser, or deploy them to GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

##  Example Output

If you have a `content/index.md` with:

```markdown
# Welcome

This is a sample site generated by Python.
```

You’ll get a file at `dist/index.html` with:

```html
<html>
<head><title>My Page</title></head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is a sample site generated by Python.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

##  Dependencies

- [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) – for converting `.md` to HTML
- [Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) – for templating

Install both via:

```bash
pip install markdown jinja2
```

---

##  Tips

- Want a different title per page? You can modify the script to extract the first line of each Markdown file as the title.
- Add more templates (e.g., blog.html) to support various layouts.
- Extend it to include file watching or navigation menus if desired!
